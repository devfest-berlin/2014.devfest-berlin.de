Can you draw Paths? What is Skia, and who invited it anyway? What actualy happens during a drawing pass? What are Shaders? What are Filters? Is it true that text is basically impossible to measure correctly? What shape does a Shape have if noone's painting it? These and other questions will get an answer during this session.

It gives game developers the ability to add precisely timed, high performant sound effects and to create realistic spatialized sound landscapes. For many web developers it is the first time they encounter audio programming which leads to many interesting experiments when the world of web and audio collide. Traditional web developers start to become really interested into audio programming and educate themselves on the topic of synthesizers and audio effects. However, currently there are only few applications that try to create audio production or audio performance environments in the browser. In this talk I want to show how the Web Audio API can be used to create a collaborative music production environment similar to Garageband. Furthermore, I will do a live demonstration of a music performance setup which is inspired by The Glitch Mob’s setup (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bXNo9MFXnU). Both demos will show how powerful the Web Audio API is and how important the web can become as platform for music production in the future.",

We support deeplinking of almost all webcontent into the app. In order to be able to do that, we implemented a sophisticated deeplinking scheme. This scheme can accept any kind of query that we could also trigger through our API. As a result, it is very straightforward to automatically create the Andrdoid (and iOS) deeplink for any content on our webpage. Our talk would start with how this deeplinking was set up and how it connects to web content. Since Google is very picky that App-Indexes provide exactly the same content as the corresponding Webpage, it is very important to have this mapping set up correctly. Since this went live we also had to add support for the Google Crawler, both on the API but also in the App. We were not really aware of that and got our tracking skewed (ie., most of our traffic was from Mountain View for a while). The second part of the talk would be about how handle these things. How to identify legit traffic and ignore crawler traffic in your tracking. This is particularly important for eCommerce companies like ourselves.",

Therefor more and more people getting interested in Visual Regression Tests. By taking and comparing screenshots of our web app on regularly basis we have the chance to catch every visual bug that occurs. These tests require an highly automated process to be able to deploy it in our continuos integration circle. Tools like PhantomCSS or WebdriverCSS made this more and more easy to do with less flakiness and frustration. This talk will give you insights about how to write visual regression tests with WebdriverCSS in an scaleable cloud environment using Sauce Labs and Applitools.
